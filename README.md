# Stepwise

### Turn tutorial videos into a knowledge base that answers questions with the exact step — and the screenshot to prove it.

Stepwise ingests YouTube videos, Google Drive recordings, Notion docs, and screenshots, then uses Claude to decompose them into structured, timestamped, **visually-grounded steps**. Ask a question in plain English and get a cited answer that links back to the precise moment in the source video.

## The problem

Support and onboarding knowledge is trapped in **video**. A 30-minute screencast might contain the one answer a user needs at the 14:32 mark — but nobody can search it, cite it, or surface it inside a support ticket. Transcripts alone aren't enough: half the information in a UI tutorial is *on the screen*, not in the narration ("click **here**, then toggle **this**").

**Stepwise makes video as searchable as documentation** — without throwing away the visual half of the signal.

## What makes it interesting

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎥 **Multimodal structuring** | Claude reads transcript + screenshots at ingest time. Steps are indexed as fused **text + CLIP-image** vectors (896-dim); retrieval is **text-first** over visually enriched descriptions. |
| 🧠 **HyDE retrieval** | Embeds a hypothetical *answer* instead of the question — closing the question↔instruction vocabulary gap. ([deep dive →](docs/hyde.md)) |
| 🔁 **Auto-ingestion** | Watch a YouTube channel, Drive folder, or Notion database. New content is detected and ingested automatically — reactive becomes proactive. |
| 🔍 **Gap detection** | Clusters queries the library *couldn't* answer well, names each gap with Claude, and suggests exactly what tutorial to record next. |
| 💸 **Cost-engineered** | Haiku for high-volume extraction, scene-change frame dedup, and prompt caching cut the expensive ingestion path by a large margin — without dropping the visual modality. |
| 🎫 **Zendesk sidebar prototype** | A Zendesk App Framework sidebar (manifest + iframe into the Stepwise UI) surfaces relevant steps on the active ticket and inserts a cited, timestamped link into the reply with one click. |

## The ingestion pipeline

Every source — a YouTube URL, a Drive `.mp4`, a Notion page, a folder of PNGs — is normalised into the **same artifact shape** (`transcript[]` + `frames[]`) and then run through one shared pipeline:

```
download ─→ transcribe ─→ extract frames ─→ dedup frames ─→ align segments
                                                                  │
   index ◄─ filter trivial ◄─ consolidate ◄─ Claude extracts steps
```

1. **Download & transcribe** — captions when available, Whisper fallback when not. Notion skips this entirely (text-first, no video).
2. **Frame extraction** — `ffmpeg` samples a frame every N seconds.
3. **Scene-change dedup** — a 32×32 grayscale diff drops near-identical consecutive frames *before* they ever reach Claude. A presenter talking to camera for 30 seconds collapses from 6 frames to 1.
4. **Semantic alignment** — transcript is chunked on sentence boundaries, with window size that **scales to video length** (fine-grained for shorts, coarse for hour-long talks).
5. **Claude structuring** — each segment (transcript + up to 2 frames) becomes typed steps via tool-use: `{title, description, action_type, confidence}`. When there's no transcript, Claude reads the steps straight off the screenshots.
6. **Consolidate & filter** — merge fragments toward ~1 step/minute, drop intros, outros, and "like & subscribe" filler.

---

## The retrieval pipeline

```
query ─→ HyDE ─→ text embed (384-d) + zero visual half ─→ tutorial pre-filter ─→ vector search ─→ cross-encoder ─→ dedup ─→ synthesize
        (Haiku)              (896-d fused query vector)      (centroid gate)        (ChromaDB)      (MiniLM rerank)         (Haiku, streamed)
```

- **HyDE** — Claude writes a hypothetical answer-shaped step; *that* gets embedded, not the raw question. Conversation history is included so follow-ups like *"how do I undo that?"* resolve correctly. ([why this works →](docs/hyde.md))
- **Text-first retrieval** — query vectors use HyDE text + a **zero visual half** (no CLIP at query time). Visual context enters search through Claude-extracted step descriptions; screenshots are returned as evidence, not used for image-to-image matching. See [docs/hyde.md](docs/hyde.md) for the full embedding scheme.
- **Tutorial pre-filter** — a per-tutorial **centroid** index gates the search: if one tutorial is clearly relevant, search is scoped to it; otherwise it falls back to the full corpus.
- **Cross-encoder re-rank** — `ms-marco-MiniLM` re-scores the top candidates for precision the bi-encoder can't reach alone.
- **Near-duplicate suppression** — steps ≥85% textually similar collapse to the best-ranked copy.
- **Streaming synthesis** — the answer streams token-by-token over SSE, grounded **only** in retrieved steps, with each step carrying its timestamp and frame.

Every query is logged with full telemetry (latencies, distances, cross-encoder scores) — which is exactly what powers **gap detection**.

---

## 💸 Cost engineering

Ingestion is the expensive path — it's where the multimodal LLM calls happen. Three levers cut that cost hard while **keeping** the visual modality intact:

| Lever | What it does | Why it's free quality |
|---|---|---|
| **Haiku for extraction** | Step extraction is a fixed-schema tool-use task. Haiku does it as well as Sonnet, at roughly an order of magnitude lower cost per token. | Sonnet is reserved for consolidation, where judgment matters most; extraction, HyDE, and synthesis run on Haiku. |
| **Scene-change frame dedup** | Drops near-identical frames before they're encoded as base64 and sent to Claude — often **40–60%** fewer image tokens on screencast content. | Identical frames carry zero new visual information. |
| **Prompt caching** | The structuring system prompt is marked `cache_control: ephemeral` — served from cache on every segment after the first. | Same prompt, every call. Pure win. |

The design principle: **cut tokens, not modalities.** A transcript-only system would be cheaper still — but it would lose half the information in a UI tutorial.

## Quickstart

### 🚀 Try the demo — no API key (under 2 minutes)

Kick the tires with zero setup. This runs only the web app against pre-baked
fixtures — **no Anthropic key, no YouTube/Whisper, no model downloads.**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up --build
# open http://localhost:3000 and click one of the three sample questions
```

You'll get cited, step-by-step answers with screenshots — the real UI, on canned
data (clearly marked with a **DEMO MODE** banner). Fixtures live in [`demo/`](demo/);
what you can't do is add your own videos. When you're ready for the real thing,
use the full stack below.

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up --build
```

- API → http://localhost:8000 (`/docs` for interactive OpenAPI)
- Web → http://localhost:3000

### Local

```bash
# Backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > .env
uvicorn stepwise.api.app:app --reload

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

> **Prerequisites:** `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp` on your PATH for video ingestion.

### Try it from the CLI

```bash
stepwise ingest "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."
stepwise query "how do I configure an API key?"
```

| `POST` | `/ingest/drive` | Ingest a Google Drive recording |
| `POST` | `/ingest/notion` | Ingest a Notion page (full block-tree parser) |
| `POST` | `/ingest/images` | Ingest screenshots / a ZIP |
| `POST` | `/query` | Ask a question — streamed SSE answer + steps |
| `POST` | `/query/sync` | Same as `/query` but returns JSON `{answer, steps}` (eval, Zendesk) |
| `GET` | `/tutorials` · `/tutorials/{id}` | Browse the library |
| `GET` `POST` | `/libraries` | List / create libraries (workspaces) |

| `GET` | `/admin/consistency` | SQLite↔Chroma vector drift report (see below) |
| `GET` | `/jobs` · `/jobs/{id}` | Background ingestion job status; the detail view adds source metadata, `started_at`, a `retryable` flag, and an `events` log of each stage |
| `POST` | `/jobs/{id}/retry` | Re-run a failed/cancelled job — supported only for YouTube jobs whose input is re-fetchable |

| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness — always cheap, no dependency checks |
| `GET` | `/ready` | Readiness — verifies DB writability + Chroma reachability (no ML models); `503` when a dependency is down |

Full interactive schema at **`/docs`** when the API is running.

Every ingest / query / watcher / gaps / admin / tutorial endpoint accepts a `library_id` (POST body field or `?library_id=` query param). It defaults to the built-in `local` library, so single-library setups need no changes. See **[Libraries (workspaces)](#libraries-workspaces)**.

`/health` and `/ready` are the probe endpoints for an orchestrator (Docker healthcheck, Kubernetes liveness/readiness, Railway). Both are exempt from `API_KEY` auth. Use `/health` for liveness (does the process respond) and `/ready` for readiness (can it actually serve traffic) — `/ready` returns a per-check breakdown, e.g. `{"status":"ready","checks":{"db":"ok","chroma":"ok"}}`.

### Vector consistency check

SQLite is the source of truth for tutorials/steps; Chroma holds the step vectors and per-tutorial centroids used by the retrieval pre-filter. The consistency check reports any drift between the two stores:

- **`tutorials_missing_vectors`** — tutorials whose steps have no vectors in Chroma
- **`vectors_missing_sqlite`** — orphaned step vectors with no matching SQLite row
- **`stale_centroids`** — centroids whose tutorial is gone (or has no backing step vectors)

Run it from the CLI:

```bash
stepwise check
```

Exit code `0` and a green ✓ mean the stores agree; a non-zero exit lists every inconsistency. The same report is available as JSON at `GET /admin/consistency` (`{"ok": true, ...}` when clean).

---

## Libraries (workspaces)

A **library** (called a *workspace* in the UI) is an isolation boundary for a corpus. Steps in one library are never retrieved by a query scoped to another — so a Stripe corpus, a Claude corpus, a demo corpus, and a user's own uploads don't pollute each other's answers.

**Local single-library mode (default).** Do nothing and everything lands in the built-in `local` library: tutorials, steps, jobs, watchers, query logs, and feedback all belong to it, and queries search it. This is the zero-config path and behaves exactly as before.

**Multi-library scoping.** Create additional libraries and tag reads/writes with a `library_id`:

```bash
# Create a library
curl -sX POST localhost:8000/libraries -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Stripe"}'          # → {"id":"<uuid>","name":"Stripe"}

# Ingest into it, then query only it
curl -sX POST localhost:8000/ingest -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://youtu.be/...","library_id":"<uuid>"}'
curl -sX POST localhost:8000/query/sync -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"how do I issue a refund?","library_id":"<uuid>"}'

# Build a whole corpus into a named library
python scripts/ingest_corpus.py --library <uuid>
```

- **Model.** A `libraries` row (`id`, `name`, `created_at`); every tutorial / step / job / watcher / query-log / feedback row carries a `library_id`. Chroma step and tutorial-centroid metadata include `library_id`, and retrieval (both the tutorial pre-filter and the step search) is confined to it.
- **Web UI.** A **Workspace** selector in the header switches the active library; the Library panel, ingestion, and queries all follow it. The choice is remembered in the browser.
- **Upgrading an existing install.** The SQLite schema auto-migrates on startup (adds `library_id`, backfilling existing rows into `local`), and a one-time, metadata-only pass tags pre-existing Chroma vectors into `local` — no re-embedding, nothing to run by hand.
- **Out of scope (for now).** Auth / per-library access control, deleting or renaming libraries, and moving tutorials between libraries.

## Watch sources & gap detection

The endgame is a system that tells you *what to record next* and ingests it the moment it appears.

```

- **Watchers** (`/watchers`) track YouTube channels (via public RSS — no API key), Drive folders (modified-time diff), and Notion databases (last-edited filter). A built-in APScheduler job polls every active source on an interval (default 30 min) and auto-queues anything new — no external cron required. `POST /watchers/poll` triggers an immediate check.
- **Gaps** (`/gaps`) embeds poorly-served queries, clusters them by cosine similarity, and asks Claude to name each gap with a suggested tutorial title and YouTube search terms.

## Configuration

Set via `.env` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | *(required)* | Claude API key |
| `STRUCTURING_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Step extraction (high volume) |
| `HYDE_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | HyDE hypothetical-answer generation |
| `SYNTHESIS_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Streamed answer synthesis |
| `CONSOLIDATION_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` | Step consolidation (judgment) |
| `FRAME_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `5` | Frame sampling interval |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Text embedding model |
| `DRIVE_TOKEN_PATH` | `./data/drive_token.json` | Google Drive OAuth token |
| `WATCHER_POLL_ENABLED` | `true` | Run the auto-ingestion scheduler in-process |
| `WATCHER_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | `30` | How often watched sources are polled |
| `API_KEY` | *(unset)* | When set, require `X-API-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer` on all routes except `/health`, `/ready`, and `/docs` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `*` | Comma-separated allowed origins, or `*` for local dev |

When `API_KEY` is set, the **API**, **web BFF** (`API_KEY` in the Next.js server env — forwarded automatically via `web/lib/backend.ts`), **Zendesk sidebar** (optional `api_key` app setting), and scripts must include the key in requests. Leave it unset for local development.

### Production checklist

Beyond a demo, set these before exposing the API:

- **`API_KEY` — required.** Generate a strong random value (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) and set it on the API and every caller (web BFF, Zendesk, scripts). Without it the API is fully open.
- **`CORS_ORIGINS` — set explicit origins.** Never ship `*` in production. List your real frontend origin(s), e.g. `CORS_ORIGINS="https://app.example.com"`. A wildcard combined with `API_KEY` is flagged with a warning at startup.
- **Back up the data volume.** All durable state lives under `DATA_DIR` (default `./data`): `stepwise.db` (SQLite — tutorials, steps, jobs, feedback, query logs) and `chroma/` (vector index). Snapshot the whole directory on a schedule; the two must be backed up together to stay consistent. The Docker image mounts this as a volume — back up the host path.
- **Model download & cache.** On first run the embedding/CLIP models (`EMBEDDING_MODEL`, ~100–500 MB) download from Hugging Face into the HF cache (`~/.cache/huggingface`, or `HF_HOME` if set). This is a one-time cost per environment but happens lazily on the first ingest/query, adding startup latency and requiring outbound network access. For reproducible/offline deploys, pre-warm the cache during image build or mount a persistent cache volume so pods don't re-download on every restart. `/ready` deliberately does **not** load these models, so it stays fast even before the cache is warm.
- **Probes & observability.** Point liveness at `/health` and readiness at `/ready`. Every request is logged with a request ID (`X-Request-ID`, generated if the client doesn't send one) and echoed back on the response; background job failures are logged with their job ID, so a failed ingest can be traced from `/jobs/{id}` to the logs.

### Choosing Claude models

Every Claude model ID lives in [`stepwise/config.py`](stepwise/config.py) — none are hard-coded in the pipeline. Each stage has its own setting so you can trade cost against quality independently:

- **`STRUCTURING_MODEL`** — high-volume step extraction; a fast, cheap model (Haiku) is the sweet spot.
- **`HYDE_MODEL`** — generates a hypothetical answer to steer retrieval; latency-sensitive, so a fast model works well.
- **`SYNTHESIS_MODEL`** — writes the final streamed answer; also fast by default.
- **`CONSOLIDATION_MODEL`** — merges and cleans extracted steps, where judgment matters most; a stronger model (Sonnet) is worth the cost.

**Model IDs change over time.** The defaults pin the models this project was built against — before changing them, check Anthropic's model overview for the current recommended IDs and pricing:

**https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview**

At the time of writing, the current model IDs are `claude-opus-5`, `claude-sonnet-5`, and `claude-haiku-4-5` — note that these carry no date suffix. Override any stage via its environment variable (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)) — for example, `CONSOLIDATION_MODEL=claude-opus-5` to use a more capable model for consolidation.

## Evaluation

A 25-query harness ([`scripts/run_eval.py`](scripts/run_eval.py)) replays realistic Stripe support questions against the tutorial corpus and scores each result against ground-truth targets. It reports **separate metrics** rather than one blended number — a no-answer win on an uncovered query is not the same as retrieving the right step. The rows below come from **two different runs** (a live full-index run and a pinned A/B benchmark), so read them as such:

| Run · metric | Scored over | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Full index · strict pass** *(lead number)* | all 25 queries | **52%** (13/25) · 76% incl. partial |
| A/B benchmark · answerable pass rate | 17 *covered* queries | 82% (14/17) |
| A/B benchmark · no-answer calibration | 8 *uncovered* queries | 75% (up from 12%) |

Strict pass (2026-07-06, 11-tutorial index) sits below the 70% target, and the gap is **corpus coverage, not ranking**: webhooks, getting-started, and integration score 100%, while misses cluster on topics the tutorials don't cover (refunds, disputes, payout timing). The A/B benchmark pins the HyDE hypothetical and candidate set, then swaps only post-processing, so its delta reflects the retrieval-quality tuning rather than run-to-run variance.

```bash
python scripts/run_eval.py --self-check              # offline smoke check
python scripts/run_eval.py --in-process              # full index
python scripts/run_eval.py --in-process --clean-corpus  # intended corpus only
```

See [docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md) for the full rubric, target, sample output, and how to run the eval safely (including which external services and API keys it needs).

## Design philosophy

> **Cut tokens, not modalities.** The cheapest system would read transcripts and stop there. Stepwise keeps the visual signal during **multimodal structuring** — Claude reads screenshots when extracting steps — and returns frame evidence with answers. Query-time search is text-first over those visually enriched descriptions.
